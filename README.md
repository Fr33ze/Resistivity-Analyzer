# Resistivity-Analyzer
This tool can observe the resistivity of an .XYZ file generated with RES2DINV. It is also capable of visualising the change rate and average over a given range of .XYZ files.

### Samples per day

### Visualise Resistivity of one Sample
The resistivities are color-encoded, where red=high and blue=low. This can be configured in the app.

### Visualise Resistiviy over time
By selecting a model block, the change of resistivity can be visualised as a line chart. Only works, if a range of .XYZ files is selected upon loading the app.

### Rate of change over range of .XYZ files
Shows how much the resistivity changes over time in the given range. Color code can be modified from the normalised values.

### Average resistivity over range of .XYZ files
Shows the average resistivity over time in the given range. Color code cannot be modified.
